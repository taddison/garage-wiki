# Typing

Currently considering the move from QWERTY on a regular keyboard to COLEMAK on a split keyboard.  Goal is not speed (though that's important to preserve - see [speed tests](https://flatgithub.com/taddison/my-data/blob/main/typing/results.csv?filename=typing%2Fresults.csv)), and more about preserving the ability to type well as I get older and more broken.
