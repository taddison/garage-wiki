# Webmentions

Per [the spec][webmention spec] a webmention is _"a simple way to notify any URL when you mention it on your site"_.

By itself this isn't terribly useful. I've 'implemented' webmentions on my [[Personal Blog]] though they're currently in what Marty McGuire calls the ['Junk Drawer' implementation].
