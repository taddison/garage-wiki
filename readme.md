# Garage Wiki

What is this?  A bit of an experiment to start [working with the garage door up] (or [learning in public]).  Might be stream-of-consciousness style notes, research for blog posts, or concepts that I'm learning.

The wiki part?  That was the easiest way to ensure [gistpad] treats this page as a wiki ðŸ˜„.
