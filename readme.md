# Garage Wiki

> This project is currently abandoned. I found myself having to frequently decide if a note should go here (in public), in a private wiki (covering anything sensitive + shared family notes), or both (create two notes).  That created too much of a barrier to writing things down, so I've now moved everything to a private repo.

What is this?  A bit of an experiment to start [working with the garage door up] (or [learning in public]).  Might be stream-of-consciousness style notes, research for blog posts, or concepts that I'm learning.

The wiki part?  That was the easiest way to ensure [gistpad] treats this page as a wiki ðŸ˜„.
