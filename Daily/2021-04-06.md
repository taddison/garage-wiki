Tailwind Intellisense and JIT mode (2.1) don't appear to play well together, with the addon throwing errors and burning a whole CPU core in VSCode.  The simplest workaround (for now) was to disable the extension - I see there are some more exotic workarounds (https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense/issues/293), though I'll hold out for an update.

Pleased to see the feature land so fast in core though - can go through and remove any references to `@tailwindcss/jit` ðŸ˜„.
