Some ideas to tidy up my [[Personal Blog]] with a view to eventually sharing it as a starter. After using several starters and having a lot of poor experiences I'd like to share something that doesn't contain many distractions. In some cases it might be minor (static data in a config file in some places but not all), but in some cases it has been extremely confusing (mixture of redundant CSS, styled-components, and inline styles). As a teaching aid some of the starters out there could generously be described as 'how not to organize your codebase' ðŸ˜….

So, on with the ideas:

- Why are link posts special? At best they're a _type_ or _category_ of post, but given that I never really stuck to a cadence perhaps they should be folded in for now. They do demo the source folder plugin I guess.
- GraphQL queries/fragments. What a mess. I'm not sure if I'm talking about GraphQL in general, the overkill it feels like in Gatsby sometimes, or the needless repetition that I'm pretty sure could be avoided with GraphQL fragments. Working in one starter I wanted to change the default image quality from 100 and it scattered over the codebase 50+ times.
- Appropriately selected semantic elements as well as microformats.
- MDX by default. This is something I need to check, but are there any disadvantages to running markdown through an mdx parser?
- Frontmatter linting. The amount of times I've been killed by changing a starter (I'll just remove this bit of frontmatter...) and it suddenly explodes with a cryptic error (looking at you again GraphQL). It could also be that far better error handling in the `gatsby-node` code would allow for a better debugging experience? Frontmatter linting (in a home-grown hacky fashion) is already helpful for some current sites for me today, could it be baked in to a starter?
