Today's mission? See if we can replace everything in [this post][styling markdown posts with tailwind css in gatsbyjs] with the [Tailwind Typography] plugin.

From a fresh branch we'll start by changing the class on posts from `markdown` to `prose`. Because the `@tailwindcss/ui` package already includes the typography plugin there isn't much more to do.

Doesn't look too bad to start! Couple of issues:

- Doesn't fill the full width of the container
- The inline code snippets render the backticks
- The colors are a little different
- Links are now styled differently
- Text leading is a little more relaxed

The good news is that apart from the container width the rest aren't really deal-breakers.
