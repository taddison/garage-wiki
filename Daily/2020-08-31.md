Today's mission? See if we can replace everything in [this post][styling markdown posts with tailwind css in gatsbyjs] with the [Tailwind Typography] plugin.

From a fresh branch we'll start by changing the class on posts from `markdown` to `prose`. Because the `@tailwindcss/ui` package already includes the typography plugin there isn't much more to do.

Doesn't look too bad to start! Couple of issues:

- Doesn't fill the full width of the container
- The inline code snippets render the backticks
- The colors are a little different
- Links are now styled differently
- Font size is smaller on desktop
- Text leading is a little more relaxed

The good news is that apart from the container width the rest aren't really deal-breakers, and it still looks great on desktop and mobile. So - let's correct the actual issues (font size, container width, and those backticks).

Font size is the easiest to fix, and changing the class to `prose prose-lg` has the font size identical to before.

Fixing the container width was as simple as updating the class to `prose prose-lg max-w-none`.

So what about those backticks?
