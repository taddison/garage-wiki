What's needed to get the [[Personal Blog]] in a state where it could be turned into a starter (see [[September 6, 2020]]):

### Semantic Markup

- [ ] Ensure appropriate elements used for blog post, blog post lists
- [ ] Add microformat classes on blog post, blog post lists
- Anything else?

### Syntax Highlighting

- [ ] Can the React-powered highlighters perform well? If so, upgrade (and if not do nothing and make a note of why not!)

### Configuration

- [ ] Centralize where possible/logical (e.g. if it _should_ be the same value)
- [ ] Document where to configure stuff
- [ ] Document why various packages have been included (and if there isn't a reason consider removing it)

### Link posts

- [x] Make them a tag and show up as a regular blog post

### GraphQL

- [ ] Review all the GraphQL and simplify/centralize (fragment) if possile
- Pre-process all the markdown to put into a posts object?

### Posts

- [ ] Document required frontmatter
- Have some kind of validation in `gatsby-node` to give better error messages?
