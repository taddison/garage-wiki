Found an [answer on GitHub][installing vc++ in a dockerfile] regarding installing VC++ that clued me in on how to get the dependency to download - turns out there is a way to get `curl` to follow redirects (of course there is!), so the following will download the file from a pretty clear link:

```shell
curl -Lo vc_redist.x64.exe  https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
```

It also points out that the way layers are constructed means my Dockerfile which downloads, installs, then cleans up - will have a layer for each of those steps!  As I'm developing the Dockerfile this is actually very useful, as I don't have to re-run the whole layer (so maybe the file downloaded but I botched up my invocation of the install command).  Need to do more reading on this to understand the impact of having lots of layers.  The [best practices][Dockerfile best practices] aren't super-clear on the _why_ of minimizing layers.
