Tried to send some manual webmention's today (using yesterday's script) - wow - no luck.

Trying to send a link from my twitter post to my own site didn't work (seems that webmention.io transforms to a Brid.gy link automatically, and as I hadn't signed up that gave an error).

Also tried using a link from a page on the internet that I know links to my blog (an [issue on GitHub] to this [post about scaling down Event Hubs]) - also failed.  This time I got a new error...

```json
{
  "status": "no_link_found",
  "source": "https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/issues/6267",
  "target": "https://tjaddison.com/blog/2019/02/auto-scale-down-all-event-hub-namespaces-with-azure-functions/",
  "summary": "The Microformats at the source URL do not contain a link to the target URL. Check the source URL in a Microformats parser such as php.microformats.io"
}
```

So I went to [php.microformats.io] and started plugging in links to try and figure out what differentiated pages that seemed to work (other people had webmentions working for them) - and it wasn't clear what made the difference.

Signed up to [brid.gy] and it managed to scrape Twitter and find everyone who mentioned my posts and submit the webmentions...so clearly the site isn't *totally* out.  Though I can't get webmention.io to accept the home page links to the about page (it most certainly does).

There does seem to be some level of link hygiene required (some docs on the [brid.gy about page] to follow), and clearly plenty to examine from the microformats2 perspective.  Testing the `/blog` page in a parser it is very clear I can do a better job linking to the articles in a parseable fashion.

Overall the whole experience still remains...fairly hard to get started with?  I _could_ slap on `webmention.js` and let the tweet bridge do all the work, but I'd like to understand what's happening in a little more depth...and those odd webmention.io errors have really thrown me.
