#Benchmarking

Carrying on from yesterday [[February 20, 2022]], there is now a sample project [on GitHub](https://github.com/taddison/dotnet-benchmarks/tree/main/DictionaryKeyLookup).  The results show that:

- .NET Framework 4.8 and .NET Core 2.1 are about the same
- .NET 5, .NET 6, and .NET Core 3.1 are about the same
- The difference between those two groups exists at every key length and widens as key length increases, from 3 nanoseconds at 1 character to 110 nanoseconds at 201 characters

The benchmark ran in increments of 25 characters (1, 26, 51) and there was little else happening, so we're almost certainly not seeing any cache misses (if we were going to main memory we'd expect 60-100ns of latency).
