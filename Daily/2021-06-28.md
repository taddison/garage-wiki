Definitely meta. Looking back over the Daily entries it's clear there is a lot of content to pull-forward (future blog posts, things to tidy up, backlinks that will maybe prompt some further thought/help out one day). So far I've been approaching cross-linking in a manner that either:

- Directly links between pages (e.g. 'on the X of June...')
- Links to a hub page with some content

What I've not done is used tags (which in GistPad are `#easy`) and accepted they're going to be blank pages collecting backlinks. This seems fine, and supports a kind of browsing I'd like to do for things like #link-roundup or #fonts.

In terms of how this works, the current convention I like is:

- Put tag pages in a \Tags\{tagname} folder
- Use hyphens when naming tags (spaces don't work, capitalization I'm not always sure makes the tag easy to read)
- Lowercase for file name
- Uppercase for folder name (tbd on this)

Creating tags is better done manually if using the GistPad extension as it puts the page in the root folder - though it can easily be moved later.

The question for me now is...what should those tags be, and will I be going to populate all the historic tags!  Maybe...
