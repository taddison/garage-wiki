## Tailwind now vs. then

Much easier to get started now!  Although the guides are excellent (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) that doesn't mean every project I've got is going to be current.  Some things that are really appreciated:

- No need to create a `styles.css` now - if you're using the defaults you can simply `import 'tailwindcss/tailwind.css'`
- No need to configure purgecss as a plugin, purge is built in
- Tailwind UI plugin has been rolled in

The JIT edition is great (https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-jit), looking forward to that being the default in 3.0.
