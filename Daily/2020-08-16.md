I've wanted to enhance the syntax highlighting on the [[Personal Blog]] for a while now - I've had a particular envy for the way the [GatsbyJS documentation] formats the code (that little language banner is sweet!).  A copy button and optional titles are also very cool.  A great example that puts these all together is the demo page for [gatsby-blog-mdx][gastby-blog-mdx sample].

After looking into how these were implemented I was a little put off at how much of it was fairly custom (I was hoping for a drop-in template to update my prismjs based code snippets).  I gave up on it and figured that if I came back again in a while someone might have made this easier (or pointed out how easy it was in the first place).  [This blog post][gatsby - syntax highlight] got me interested again.  After seeing the implementation:

- It is now clear that I'll have to maintain the CSS for each language tag manually (was hoping for that to be packaged up)
- Looks like this has both server-side and client-side implementations - what will the impact (if any) be on performance/lighthouse scores?
- Does this run on all pages, or is there a way to inject the formatter only as required (bundle size?)

Is [prism-react-renderer] the way to go here?  Should I monkey-patch the tags in directly? Is the best course of action to just wait a little longer for that drop-in replacement ðŸ˜…?
