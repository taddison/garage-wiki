## Mind your spaces

Google search console suggested there were some 404s...and one of them looked like a bad link from me: `../post/CRA`. I found the post in question, and this looked like an obvious mistake - forgetting a space when I wanted to show an abbreviation rather than create a link:

```markdown
I'm a fan of [create react app](CRA)
```

However adding the space and saving triggered automatic formatting, which removes the space. The solution was easy enough, if a little duplicative:

```
I'm a fan of [create react app][create react app] (CRA)
```

## Relative links

Since installing `gatsby-remark-external-links` a few links to my own site have been getting tagged as `rel="external"`. You can whitelist a domain with another plugin (`https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-relative-links/`), or you can make them all relative.

```markdown
<!-- don't do this -->

[some page on my blog]: https://tjaddison.com/blog/2020/01/cool-post

<!-- do this instead -->

[some page on my blog]: /blog/2020/01/cool-post
```

This was easy enough to correct. However I also noticed that internal links from markdown are not getting the same performance-enhancing treatment that a `<Link to="/bla">` tag might get, which kind of sucks. Googling but not finding a whole lot...

_time passes_

Took longer than I expected but there is actually an easy answer - https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-catch-links/. Finds relative links and 'upgrades' them to using the `gatsby-link` behaviour.

> This wasn't a slam-dunk - before I had some relative links pointing to the old-style scheme which would have been handled by my redirects in Netlify. Now I've added the new plugin I have to go back and fix them - which ultimately is a better experience for the user anyway. Not sure if crawlers will catch these or not.
