## Creating a new blog post with an npm script

Wanted to do this for a while, and figured it would be a neat feature to have on the [[Personal Blog]] - especially if I ever get around to releasing it as a starter.  Found someone who has built a great starting point - https://joelhooks.com/a-handy-npm-script-for-creating-a-new-gatsby-blog-post.

What I'd like to do is extend that and turn it into something a little closer to the `npm init` experience - ask a bunch of questions and allow defaults to skip past a bunch (I don't mind mashing enter a half-dozen times).  Things that _do_ change and require a bunch of moving things around:

- Post title
- Post date
- Post format (I'll start with `.md` and only make it `.mdx` if it actually has anything other than markdown in it)

So how much work is required to get there from the sample code?

Writing a few questions was harder than I expected, but with Node15 we can use top-level await (which makes the code reach much terser).  Only requirements are:
- The package.json now needs to refer to `scripts/newpost.mjs` rather than `scripts/newpost` (the latter only seems to resolve `.js`)
- We use import rather than require

And then code like this works:
```javascript
import { createInterface } from "readline"

const rl = createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
})

const question = function (q) {
  return new Promise((res) => {
    rl.question(q, (answer) => {
      res(answer)
    })
  })
}

const foo = await question("hey")

rl.close()
```

With thanks to https://stackoverflow.com/a/46488389 for the question function.
