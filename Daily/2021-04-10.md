## Creating a new blog post with an npm script

Wanted to do this for a while, and figured it would be a neat feature to have on the [[Personal Blog]] - especially if I ever get around to releasing it as a starter.  Found someone who has built a great starting point - https://joelhooks.com/a-handy-npm-script-for-creating-a-new-gatsby-blog-post.

What I'd like to do is extend that and turn it into something a little closer to the `npm init` experience - ask a bunch of questions and allow defaults to skip past a bunch (I don't mind mashing enter a half-dozen times).  Things that _do_ change and require a bunch of moving things around:

- Post title
- Post date
- Post format (I'll start with `.md` and only make it `.mdx` if it actually has anything other than markdown in it)

So how much work is required to get there from the sample code?
