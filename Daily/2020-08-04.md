Some thoughts on starting a blog/microblog, based on my personal experience:

- The most important thing is to produce content - markdown is still the best format for this and can trivially be turned into posts in a variety of ways
- I spent a lot of time blogging with GitHub pages (which has integrated Jekyll support).  This is a great, low-friction way to get started.  I used the [Beautiful Jekyll] theme, and still recommend it.  Check out the [get started] page.
- When I wanted more control over my blog (and didn't want to pick up Ruby), I decided to move to Gatsby.  The learning curve was large (nodejs, graphql, react) - and if I didn't already have some rudimentary knowledge in those areas I'd have floundered
  - There is a great template library available, but the curation isn't great if you want to reverse engineer best-practices from them (why did they code in this way? probably because, like me, they didn't know any better)
  - I'm happy now I've mastered the platform (and I use it for plenty of other sites), but every time I have to debug a graphql error part of me dies inside
  - I wrote about my experiences [migrating from Jekyll to Gatsby] - the speed of the Gatsby site is pretty phenomenal (100s all round on lighthouse)
- If you want to host a site for free I highly recommend [Netlify]
- One static site generator that caught my eye recently is [eleventy (11ty)]
- Other tools I really love are [tailwind css] and [GistPad].  I recently wrote about how much I love GistPad [on my blog][gistpad post]
  - GistPad has support for [GistLog], a micro-blogging platform powered by gists
