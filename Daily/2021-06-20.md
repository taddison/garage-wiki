## Benchmarking

Some thoughts after looking at what it would take to run some benchmarks remotely (motivations are to not tie up a developer machine + ensure consistency for comparisons).

Any BenchmarkDotNet benchmarks will require all the frameworks/dotnet CLI to be installed - so either preparing the host in advance, or configuring a container to execute the benchmarks against.

Crank also looks like something worth investigating - essentially queueing up benchmarks to get executed in order (on a remote agent), and have the results all stored either locally (agent) or in a SQL database.
