# My UUID
az ad signed-in-user show --query objectId

Made some changes in Azure (deleted the app) - Pulumi preview couldn't recover.

pulumi stack rm tjaddison/fa-test/prod --force

Force is needed as Pulumi thinks there are cloud resources still present.

Below code fails to create the application password (cannot find the application id?).  Could be poor setup in how the parameters are passed around (though the ID it operates on is the correct one).

```csharp
using Pulumi;
using Pulumi.AzureAD;

class MyStack : Stack
{
  public MyStack()
  {
    // Create an Azure AD application
    var adApp = new Application("FunctionAppTest-Prod", new ApplicationArgs
    {
      DisplayName = "FunctionAppTest-Prod",
      SignInAudience = "AzureADMyOrg",
      Owners = new[] { "{user id of owner}" }
    }
    );

    // ClientId
    var applicationId = adApp.ApplicationId.Apply(appId => appId);

    var applicationPassword = new ApplicationPassword("FA-FunctionAppTest-Prod-Password", new ApplicationPasswordArgs
    {
      ApplicationObjectId = applicationId,
      DisplayName = "Password for function app"
    });

    // ClientSecret
    var password = applicationPassword.Value.Apply(pwd => pwd);
  }
}

```

The issue was that `applicationId` is not needed, and the object's `id` is.

So the below code _does_ work:

```csharp
  var id = adApp.Id.Apply(objectId => objectId);

  var applicationPassword = new ApplicationPassword("FA-FunctionAppTest-Prod-Password", new ApplicationPasswordArgs
  {
    ApplicationObjectId = id,
    DisplayName = "Password for function app"
  });
```

[This GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/microsoft-graph-docs/issues/3539) finally clued me in (I'd read ApplicationObjectId and assumed applicationId!)

Some additional notes:
- The _logical_ name of most of these resources (azure ad app, password) aren't used - see https://www.pulumi.com/blog/infrastructure-as-code-resource-naming/ for examples of where they are used (as the basis of a physical name)
- Adding self (userid) as an owner allows for update/secret management/delete - otherwise the application administrator user role is required
