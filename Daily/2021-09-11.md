```
dotnet add package Pulumi.Azuread
```

https://www.pulumi.com/docs/reference/pkg/azuread/application/
https://www.pulumi.com/docs/reference/pkg/azuread/applicationpassword/

Get current user UUID:
```
az ad signed-in-user show --query objectId
```

Made some changes in Azure (deleted the app) - Pulumi preview couldn't recover.

```
pulumi stack rm tjaddison/fa-test/prod --force
```

Force is needed as Pulumi thinks there are cloud resources still present.

Below code fails to create the application password (cannot find the application id?).  Could be poor setup in how the parameters are passed around (though the ID it operates on is the correct one).

```csharp
using Pulumi;
using Pulumi.AzureAD;

class MyStack : Stack
{
  public MyStack()
  {
    // Create an Azure AD application
    var adApp = new Application("FunctionAppTest-Prod", new ApplicationArgs
    {
      DisplayName = "FunctionAppTest-Prod",
      SignInAudience = "AzureADMyOrg",
      Owners = new[] { "{user id of owner}" }
    }
    );

    // ClientId
    var applicationId = adApp.ApplicationId.Apply(appId => appId);

    var applicationPassword = new ApplicationPassword("FA-FunctionAppTest-Prod-Password", new ApplicationPasswordArgs
    {
      ApplicationObjectId = applicationId,
      DisplayName = "Password for function app"
    });

    // ClientSecret
    var password = applicationPassword.Value.Apply(pwd => pwd);
  }
}

```

The issue was that `applicationId` is not needed, and the object's `id` is.

So the below code _does_ work:

```csharp
  var id = adApp.Id.Apply(objectId => objectId);

  var applicationPassword = new ApplicationPassword("FA-FunctionAppTest-Prod-Password", new ApplicationPasswordArgs
  {
    ApplicationObjectId = id,
    DisplayName = "Password for function app"
  });
```

[This GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/microsoft-graph-docs/issues/3539) finally clued me in (I'd read ApplicationObjectId and assumed applicationId!)

## Some additional notes
- The _logical_ name of most of these resources (azure ad app, password) aren't used - see https://www.pulumi.com/blog/infrastructure-as-code-resource-naming/ for examples of where they are used (as the basis of a physical name)
- Adding self (userid) as an owner allows for update/secret management/delete - otherwise the application administrator user role is required
- https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer is useful for debugging

## Some things to look at next
- Create a function app, and configure AzureAD authentication using the app registration
- Where to put the owner user id (config)
- How to have placeholders (to share the repo in public without sharing values that actually work) - gitignore the stack config? secret in the console? config value in the console? other?
- Deploy a function to the function app (do a redirect, verify auth flow works)
- Set the target tenant, subscription to deploy into

## Setting the sub
> - Select your target subscription with the Azure CLI: az account set --subscription SUBSCRIPTION
> - Use pulumi config set azure:subscriptionId SUBSCRIPTION.
> - Set the environment variable ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID.
> - Use Explicit Providers and configure it in the provider's properties.

So if I set the cli account will Pulumi remember which sub it deployed an RG to?

- Set CLI to Sub 1
- Create an RG
- Set CLI to Sub 2
- Add tags to RG

The answer is yes - as the id of the RG includes the sub.  The approach seems fine for testing, but ultimately not great for repeatable work - the pulumi config seems better.

Testing that:
```
pulumi config set azure-native:subscriptionId {guid of the target sub}
```

> Note this is using azure-native, not azure (legacy) as in the SO answer

- Add Sub 1 to config
- Set CLI to Sub 1
- Create RG

And this also works - creates in the correct subscription.
