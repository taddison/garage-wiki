#healthspan #quantified-self

Discussing weight training today and it's clear there are some great ways to trivially measure progress/status that are good proxies for something meaningful (health/wellness).

Expressed as a fraction of bodyweight the bench press/deadlift/squat 1RM (one repetition max) benefit from being widely practiced for a wide range of the population (gender, age, training level).  [Strength Standards](https://strengthlevel.com/strength-standards) shows a good example of the kind of data available, though I'd love it without so many adverts.

While considering more deliberate practice with yoga, I wondered what outcomes to look at there (flexibility, resting heart rate, maybe some strength measures).  It's not the main reason to pursue yoga, though physical improvement is definitely a side-effect I'm interested in.

To tie all of this together, is there any research on the impact this has on healthspan or other longer-term outcomes.  That photo of the 70-year old triathelete vs. 74-year old sedentary vs. 40-year old triathelete springs to mind.
