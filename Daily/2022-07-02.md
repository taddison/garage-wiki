PinIt slackbot.  Will aim to host on Vercel (cannot use @slack/bolt as it spins up an express server).  Not able to use the Slack future api yet (closed beta).

Pre-reqs:
- Create a test workspace (not required but let's limit the blast radius)
- ngrok (local development - Slack servers need to call into the endpoints)
  - brew install --cask ngrok
  - Optional: create an account and authenticate it (for monitoring)

Steps:
- Create an app in Slack
- Update the manifest - below example shows a single command (`/list-pins`)
- Create a next app (npx create-next app)
- Update the api endpoint to be `list-pins.js`
- Install the app into the workspace

```yaml
display_information:
  name: PinIt
features:
  bot_user:
    display_name: PinIt
    always_online: false
  slash_commands:
    - command: /list-pins
      url: https://481b-72-69-209-231.ngrok.io/api/list-pins
      description: List all open pins
      should_escape: false
oauth_config:
  scopes:
    bot:
      - commands
settings:
  org_deploy_enabled: false
  socket_mode_enabled: false
  token_rotation_enabled: false
```

> Note that updating the `url` and hitting save takes immediate effect, no need to reinstall the app

At this point everything works.  We're not actually verifying the request comes from Slack, nor are we doing anything to slack, but if you use `/list-pins` in any channel you _will_ get back `{"name":"John Doe"}`.
