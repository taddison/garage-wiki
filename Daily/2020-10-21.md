Turned out my [[Personal Blog]] has been render blocking ever since I added the [Inter font]. This isn't the absence of `font-display: swap`, but actually relates to the time taken to download the CSS. Given we render the site without the font, why should we block the rendering for the CSS?

Good news is this is easy to fix, and the technique is linked to from [web.dev lighthouse results][defer css]. The following change pushes the CSS after the first contentful paint:

```diff
- <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://rsms.me/inter/inter.css"></link>
+ <link crossOrigin="anonymous" rel="preload" href="https://rsms.me/inter/inter.css" as="style" onLoad="this.onload=null;this.rel='stylesheet'"></link>
```

Note this is in Gatsby so specifying `crossOrigin` alone will actually output `crossOrigin="true"` which is not what we want.
