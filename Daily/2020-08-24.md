# August 24, 2020

Let's take the base R image we built yesterday ([[August 19, 2020]]) and add some scripts on.  We'll aim to get a script that installs a dependency, and another script that does something.

Starting from our base script which we create as `rservercore`:

```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:2004

RUN mkdir c:\tmp
RUN curl.exe -o c:\tmp\r-install.exe https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/3.6.3/R-3.6.3-win.exe
RUN c:\tmp\r-install.exe /VERYSILENT /DIR="C:\R\"

RUN powershell remove-item c:\tmp -recurse
```
