# August 24, 2020

Let's take the base R image we built yesterday ([[August 19, 2020]]) and add some scripts on.  We'll aim to get a script that installs a dependency, and another script that does something.

Starting from our base script which we create as `rservercore`:

```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:2004

RUN mkdir c:\tmp
RUN curl.exe -o c:\tmp\r-install.exe https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/3.6.3/R-3.6.3-win.exe
RUN c:\tmp\r-install.exe /VERYSILENT /DIR="C:\R\"

RUN powershell remove-item c:\tmp -recurse
```

We now layer on two files - dependencies, and script (both in a scripts folder) - the folder (called `rscripts`) looks like this:

```
|
|-dockerfile
|-scripts
|--dependencies.r
|--script.r
```

With the contents of the files:

```dockerfile
# dockerfile
FROM rservercore

COPY ./scripts c:/scripts

RUN c:\R\bin\Rscript.exe c:\scripts\dependencies.r

CMD c:\R\bin\Rscript.exe c:\scripts\script.r
```

And the R files:

```r
# dependencies.r
print("hello from dependencies.r")

# scripts.r
print("hello from script.r")
```

And then building & running this looks like this:

```
❯ docker build .\rscripts -t rscripts

❯ docker run --rm rscripts

[1] "hello from script.r"
```

This shows that we can execute the install scripts at the time the image is built.  Although the scripts here are trivial they're all we need to prep the container and then run it later.

Next up - having the container talk to SQL Server (which may involve configuring ODBC - _great_).

> When testing the documentation calls out that windows containers require forward slashes to work, yet I had no issues with back slashes.  Will see if this survives contact with Windows Server... https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-docker/manage-windows-dockerfile
