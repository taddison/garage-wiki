Research for [[Webmentions]], driven mainly by the desire to add commenting back on my [[Personal Blog]] but no desire to use something like Disqus (ads, bloated) or Staticman (prior poor experience).

Originally saw this on swyx's blog post [clientside webmentions] which also introduced me to the [indieweb].

Some interesting articles on the subject
