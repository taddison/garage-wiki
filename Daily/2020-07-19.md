Research for [[Webmentions]], driven mainly by the desire to add commenting back on my [[Personal Blog]] but no desire to use something like Disqus (ads, bloated) or Staticman (prior poor experience).

Originally saw this on swyx's blog post [clientside webmentions] which also introduced me to the [indieweb].

Some interesting articles on the subject and tools in the ecosystem:

- The [official spec]
- The description of [webmention on indieweb]
- The [webmention developer page on indieweb]
- [webmention.io] will act as a sink and store for your webmentions
- [brid.gy] will scrape sites to find mentions (e.g. on Twitter)

Starting off with webmention.io and brid.gy seems like a no-brainer, and there is no need to display those comments anyway (so adding the webmention metadata after creating the accounts should be enough). After that client-side or server-side pulls are something to experiment with (even with server-side if you want things live you _have_ to implement client-side, so that feels like the obvious place to start).

Some areas I'd like to explore more are native comment functionality (a _really_ low friction way to comment is a box you type in), and storing a copy of the comments (likes, mentions, etc.) somewhere. Querying webmention.io on every build seems wasteful if we can use a high-watermark to only pull new information? Lots to explore in the [webmention API].

The indieweb has an awful lot of stuff to go through. Agree with a lot of it up to a point (e.g. [POSSE] - Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere) - but publishing a message on my site to syndicate that vs. tweeting directly? Not so sure (obviously not tweeting anything right now makes that a moot point). The underlying message of own your data I'm 100% on board with, so is this a case of the friction being a problem (if it was zero hassle...)?

Got sidetracked for a while reading up on [microformats2] (I've been thinking about metadata for blog posts recently) - though seems like [schema.org] might be a better place to invest, purely based on interest over time and the fact Google seems to [lean that way][google structured data].

Next steps here are to make sure I understand the basics (and document them on the [[Webmentions]] page), signup for the services, and implement the metadata on my [[Personal Blog]]. And then I guess I really need to start tweeting :smile:.
