Research for [[Webmentions]], driven mainly by the desire to add commenting back on my [[Personal Blog]] but no desire to use something like Disqus (ads, bloated) or Staticman (prior poor experience).

Originally saw this on swyx's blog post [clientside webmentions] which also introduced me to the [indieweb].

Some interesting articles on the subject and tools in the ecosystem:
- The [official spec]
- The description of [webmention on indieweb]
- The [webmention developer page on indieweb]
- [webmention.io] will act as a sink and store for your webmentions
- [brid.gy] will scrape sites to find mentions (e.g. on Twitter)
