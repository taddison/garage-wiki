Syncing some ideas to 'paper' (see [1], [2]):

- Noise levels - what's normal?  What's the impact on sleep quality? On concentration? If we knew an aircon unit was 10dB louder in apartment A vs. B would that make a difference?  A low-friction way of tracking this would be fun (starting with an existing app and logging it, graduating to computing the value from a recorded sample).
- Why isn't there a common link to a semi-authoritative source on various things that come up in SQL code reviews?  Could write at length about a lot of these (ranging from stylistic to where we got burned in prod), and with a stable URI responses can improve from 'no select *' to 'also see ...'.  Linters can and should correct a lot of these, but when it goes beyond stylistic...whats the provenance of that rule?  Markdown for rules and then a GatsbyJS site (although 11ty looks faster figure it's worth getting competent in Gatsby first).
- A now page for the [[Personal Blog]]
