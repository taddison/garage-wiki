Time to add some microformats2 to the [[Personal Blog]] blog entries.

Specific changes:
- Wrap the post in an `<article>` tag
- Use the `time` element for the article date
- Add classes for the key bits of metadata
  - `h-entry` for the whole article
  - `p-name` for the post title
  - `e-content` for the post content
  - `dt-published` for the date published

And I didn't implement but considered:
  - `p-category` for each category (`rel="tag"` is supposed to parse as this)

After these changes my blog posts now correctly worked with tools like [webmention.app] - so I'll soon be ready to start sending out [[Webmentions]]
