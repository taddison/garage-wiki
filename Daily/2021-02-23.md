What's hanging out in the default `.eslintrc.json` file I've been using in my Gatsby project (in my [[Personal Blog]]?

Let's take them in order...

- parser - if we want to use syntax supported by e.g. babel, then we need ESLint to use that parser
- extends - which configuration files to use (which can turn on or off rules)
- plugins - which plugins to register (which won't turn rules on/off just by registering them)
- env - which environments are valid? Currently browser, node, and es6 (but there are more https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/language-options#specifying-environments)
- globals - which globals are valid?
  - Deleted all of them as none of them are used (testing, some Gatsby internal stuff)
- parserOptions
  - ecmaFeatures - jsx - enables jsx
  - ecmaVersion - this one is complex, the docs say it best - but basically es6 syntax (via env) doesn't bring support for es6 globals
  - sourceType - defaults to script, we want modules
- rules - turn on/off individual rules - will review this later!
- overrides - change globals/env/rules for various files, though deleted them all as none of them are present in the project
- settings - contains settings for plugins
  - react - we can detect the version or specify it here, and as it's wildly out of date I switched to detect

Some changes I did make to rules:

- Follow recommendations on prettier, so as well as loading the plugin extending plugin:prettier/recommended (turns off conflicting eslint rules, adds prettier violations as warnings)
- Remove the jsdoc rules (deprecated many versions ago in ESLint)
