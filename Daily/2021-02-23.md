What's hanging out in the default `.eslintrc.json` file I've been using in my Gatsby project?

Let's take them in order...

- parser - if we want to use syntax supported by e.g. babel, then we need ESLint to use that parser
- extends - which configuration files to use (which can turn on or off rules)
- plugins - which plugins to register (which won't turn rules on/off just by registering them)
