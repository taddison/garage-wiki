## Exporting data from Pocket Budget
Currently there is a web-based export, using firebase-firestore-lite (web SDK) and react-csv.  I'd like to automate the 'backup' via something like a GitHub action, and so using the admin SDK is probably a better fit.  Using the export CLI requires you to be on a paid plan, which I'm not.

Starting with a new vanilla TS project:

```shell
npm init --yes
npm install typescript -D
tsc --init
```

After downloading the service account key from the Firestore project, access a document with:

```typescript
import { initializeApp, cert } from 'firebase-admin/app';
import { getFirestore } from 'firebase-admin/firestore';

initializeApp({
  credential: cert("C:\\path\\to\\key.json"),
});

(async () => {
  const db = getFirestore();
  const queryResult = await db.collection('transactions').limit(1).get();
  console.log(queryResult.docs[0].data());
})();
```

Importing the key (`import serviceAccount from 'key.json'`) and passing to `cert()` failed for a variety of different reasons, as did attempting to get top-level await working.  The latter feels like a world of pain to get working right now, the former seems like I'm doing something wrong...

OK - the issue was the type needed to be specified (make TS happy, the JS SDK doesn't care).  The below works (assuming `resolveJsonModule` is set to `true` in `tsconfig.json`):

```typescript
import { initializeApp, cert, ServiceAccount } from 'firebase-admin/app';
import serviceAccount from './key.json';

initializeApp({
  credential: cert(serviceAccount as ServiceAccount),
});
```

This [GitHub issue](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-admin-node/issues/522) had the workaround.  There is a fix to the SDK in an [open PR](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-admin-node/pull/1110/files), but not sure that'll land.

Next steps are to build the download (should be a copy-paste from the existing repo - one-shot to start, add pagination in eventually), export to a reasonable format (probably JSONLines), and then look at what it'd take to get in a GitHub action (won't be checking in the key.json file!).
