Looking into the microformat parser, it's clear that any link with no `rel` attribute won't show up.  This should explain why I can't see internal or external links on the site.

Tackling external links can be solved with [gatsby-remark-external-links] - and adding the `rel="external"` attribute to them all.  For internal links it isn't all that clear what `rel` values are supported/current or not (the [existing rel page on the microformats wiki] isn't super-clear).

Is some of this because microformats are dying (dead?) and schema.org/JSONLD are the future?  Would like to capture some of this metadata in an an implementation-agnostic manner (it's an external link, or it's a reply...).

Thought about some kind of extension in markdown links - not sure if it's possible yet but will take a look in the future:

```markdown
This sentence has a [link to my root page][link to the root:home]

[link to the root:home]: https://tjaddison.com
```

And it would be rendered as...

```html
<a href="https://tjaddison.com" rel="home">
```

I love the portability of my posts (a few rough edges around image handling aside) - so is there a way to use the existing markdown format without needing a jump up to mdx?
