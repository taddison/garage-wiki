Let's get started with [[Webmentions]]!

## Create your IndieLogin
The only way to sign up for [webmention.io] is via [IndieLogin].  In my case I chose to use Twitter by adding the following to my site's head:

```html
<link href="https://twitter.com/tjaddison" rel="me">
```

I couldn't get it to work initially, and then realized that having my site linked in my Twitter bio isn't the same as having it linked in the Website section of my profile.  Once that was changed I was able to complete my indie login as `tjaddison.com`.


## Sign up for webmention.io
Signing up on [webmention.io] was as simple as entering `https://tjaddison.com` as I'm already logged in with IndieLogin.

After that I can start accepting webmentions by placing the following snippets in the head of my site:

```html
<link rel="webmention" href="https://webmention.io/tjaddison.com/webmention" />
<link rel="pingback" href="https://webmention.io/tjaddison.com/xmlrpc" />
```

> I've added these to my sites `SEO.js` page along with the earlier Twitter link.  The site now has a mixture of hardcoded and config-driven.  I figure these should really get fixed and pulled into config once I've verified I've got it all configured properly.

## Send a test webmention
Testing this was...rough.  After verifying the markup was being rendered correctly I found the [indiewebify.me tester], though no amount of cajoling would get any webmentions to show up on the [webmention.io] dashboard.  No dice.

Next stop was doing it manually via PowerShell:

```powershell
$fields = @{
    source="https://tjaddison.com";
    target="https://tjaddison.com/about";
}

$webmentionUri = "https://webmention.io/tjaddison.com/webmention"

$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Method Post `
                  -Uri $webmentionUri `
                  -ContentType "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" `
                  -Body $fields

$response.StatusCode
$response.Content
```

The content includes a link to the webmention which is helpful for debugging - in my case I'd passed in a webmention to me, from me.  The debug site tells me that:

```json
{
  "status": "no_link_found",
  "source": "https://tjaddison.com",
  "target": "https://tjaddison.com/about",
  "summary": "The source document does not have a link to the target URL"
}
```

So it looks like everything is working as intended.  Now all I need is some webmentions from someone that isn't me.

## Next steps?

Next up is [brid.gy] which will connect Twitter comments to [webmention.io].

Something to review is how to enable anonymous comments (not a scenario I want for my blog, but there are other sites where comments won't be coming from a source URL - webmention does't really solve that).

I suppose I could also go and find a few places my site is linked to around the web and manually send some webmentions.

And then after all of that a process to pull the webmentions down and include in the site (probably via a process that includes them in the repo along with the site to speed up builds and not hit webmention.io every time).  And then of course the client-side refresh...
