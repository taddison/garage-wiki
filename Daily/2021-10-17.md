First round of tests on [monkeytype.com]

- QWERTY
- Das Keyboard Model S
- Standing
- British English, Punctuation
- 120s
- 10AM
- 1k - 102 wpm, 97.6% accuracy
- 5k - 92 wpm, 95.1% accuracy
- 10k - 94 wpm, 95.9% accuracy

1k felt like a good set of drills, but not reflective of the writing I do on a daily basis, and even the 5k didn't really have the technical vocabulary I use.  10k didn't feel much different to 5k in terms of difficulty.  The test also produces a consistency stat but I'm not sure that's useful to track - slowing down for difficult passages vs. high speed for easier passages isn't something that I want to avoid, especially if the overall goal is to reduce travel-time (extend typing longevity).

As this is data I'd like to track over time _and_ it's not particularly private, it feels like a good candidate for [Flat Data viewer](https://next.github.com/projects/flat-data).
