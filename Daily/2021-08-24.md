Still more to come...

### Security beyond on-premise

While the tier model worked well for on-premise networks, it wasn't a good fit for a hybrid or cloud-native org (or basically any environment where you need to have [Zero Trust](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/)).  If you're familiar with the tier model then the [Privileged Access Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/compass/privileged-access-access-model) provides a mapping from old to new.

### Azure

The discussion of [how the Urlist app is built] covers a lot of ground, and along the way hits Front Door, Cosmos DB, CNAME flattening, Azure Functions and more.  It's eminently practical and also covers cost (which is never present on architecture diagrams), and left me with a better understanding of how some of the different tools fit together.

When deploying all of those apps to Azure perhaps rather than inflicting [ARM templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) on yourself you could instead use the new [Bicep language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview).  It's definitely an improvement, but I don't know if it's enough of an improvement over something like [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) to be worth learning.

I've still not really leveraged durable functions, but found the [new backend announcement](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure/new-storage-providers-for-azure-durable-functions/ba-p/2382044) to be particularly interesting.

The [SQL backend](https://microsoft.github.io/durabletask-mssql/) I was curious about as I've had some painful experiences with workflow/orchestration inside of SQL Server before, and one of the notes at the bottom did kind of confirm what I had seen before:

>  In many cases, the database will be the primary performance bottleneck.

But with the option to use the [Netherite provider](https://microsoft.github.io/durabletask-netherite/) there is a faster, cheaper (albeit more setup required) option.  The [FASTER](https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER) technology that is used by Netherite is..._fast_!

And finally - tying together Security and durable functions is [Cloud Katana](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/08/19/automating-security-assessments-using-cloud-katana/).  Love the work Microsoft security are doing to let people improve and iterate on security _safely_ (knowing where to start is hard, this is a fantastic onramp).

### Javascript

Looking forward to hopefully seeing the [proposal for JSON modules](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-json-modules) make it into the standard.  I've got a whole bunch of JSON being imported in various utility tools, and if it could fail-fast if it's no longer JSON (for any reason), so much the better.

```javascript
import json from "./foo.json" assert { type: "json" };
```

And now looking back, after reading [authentication in React apps](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/authentication-in-react-applications) it is hard to unsee the many times I have made the same mistakes over and over.  At least next time I need to write an app I've got a solid pattern to follow, and maybe one day I'll refactor some existing code into the pattern (hahaha...).

Looking forward again I'm already fairly confident that Next.js + Tailwindcss are my go-to choices for building, but hosting is a little trickier.  While I've been very happy with Netlify for static sites, because Next.js integrates so tightly with Vercel that's probably an upcoming shift I'll make.  But nothing has yet dislodged firebase/firestore as the go-to *web accessible* database to use...until I started reading about Supabase.  And given it's actually SQL (hooray!) I'm even _more_ interested than I was before.  Reading through [an end to end tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-complete-guide-to-full-stack-development-with-supabas/) has convinced me this is worth exploring more.

Another missing piece of my puzzle is how to make calls to that backend - in most cases I'm using a straightforward `useFirestore` hook that has some home-rolled caching, but after reading through [practical react-query](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/practical-react-query) I'm wondering if that might not be a better fit.  I started the series with [react-query as a state manager](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/react-query-as-a-state-manager) and was hooked, and promptly went back to the beginning.

### My debugging hero

I didn't think I *had* a debugging hero, but then I read another of Bruce Dawson's posts (this time on [Arranging Invisible Icons in Quadractic time](https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2021/02/16/arranging-invisible-icons-in-quadratic-time/)) and then realised that actually, I do!

### Agency

As a (relatively) freshly minted parent I'm now starting to think about education, and reflecting back on my experiences I can say that I'd like to do better.  Reading [The most precious resource is agency](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency) struck a chord, mainly in that outside of the social value of school, I'm not sure how valuable it is compared to what it could be.
