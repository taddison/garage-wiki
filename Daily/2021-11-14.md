#to-blog #link-roundup

Not clear whether this is supposed to be a collection of links, or paragraphs which form a cohesive whole?  The sections definitely don't have any relation (so I'll explicitly not refer to items from other sections I guess?), but there are a few cases where 3/4 of the links weave together, and then a final link is just hanging out, barely avoiding a relegation to the 'misc' section.  I suppose that's fine - if you come for a 'link roundup', I hope you won't shoot me for a lack of narrative weaving through the link collection?

## Development

Capturing my frustrations on what an `npm-outdated` looks like for my Gatsby-powered blog, Ru Singh's [waving goodbye to static websites and more](https://rusingh.com/waving-thankful-goodbye-to-static-websites-and-more/) does make the 'DIY' option look like a poor choice.  Every time I think about switching to Wordpress (or something else) I run through the framework I used last time I switched by blog ([back in 2019](https://tjaddison.com/blog/2019/09/migrating-from-jekyll-to-gatsby/)) and always land on static sites.  For now.

One important feature for me is cost - ideally free, and [stack on a budget](https://github.com/255kb/stack-on-a-budget) is a good place to look for inspiration.  Another feature is performance, and [Speedlify](https://www.zachleat.com/web/speedlify/) can let you track performance over time (though Lighthouse scores are not [without their challenges](https://www.zachleat.com/web/lighthouse-deception/)).

Another month goes by and the GitHub issues for [optimize images during next build](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/19065)...maybe inches towards being implemented? I'll probably have to ignore this and rely on the default `next/image` component, though I'm not a fan of being locked into Vercel (as a free host).  When the time comes to migrate, the [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) library is probably how I'll get the MD/MDX used (there's even a [starter template](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mdx-remote)).

Finally, if you find yourself wanting a reminder of what the relentless pursuit of pragmatism looks like, these [quotes from Rasmus Lerdorf](https://en.m.wikiquote.org/wiki/Rasmus_Lerdorf) (creator of PHP) are worth reviewing.  As a taster - _"I actually hate programming, but I love solving problems."_

## Management and Leadership

Scaling security across an organization is _hard_ - Clint Gibler's presentation [How to 10X your security](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lfEvXtw5RTj3JmXwSQDXy8or87_BHrFbo1ZtQQlHbq0/view#slide=id.g6555b225cd_0_1069) is an excellent starting point (and probably covers stuff that most orgs won't even get in their end-state).  Clint also maintains the excellent infosec newsletter [tldrsec.com](https://tldrsec.com/), which reduces the firehose of infosec news to a ...slightly smaller firehose?

A common criticism of a lot of business books I read is 'that could have been a long-form article'.  Imagine my delight when I discovered [The Kool Aid Factory](https://koolaidfactory.com/), a site full of zines (here: long-form articles) that cover various aspects of organizational design.  In addition to having a tonne of great content, the content filters allow you to start with a subset of the content (though I ended up devouring everything - no filters for me!).

From articles that resisted becoming books, to a presentation that resisted becoming a book - [Coordination Headwind - How organizations are like slime molds](https://komoroske.com/slime-mold/) covers the challenge of keeping an organization nimble as it grows.

I've always felt a little uneasy with the advice that states you should 'never be the smartest person in the room', as for me it seems like a crutch to lean on when you don't want to have a conversation about the values of a diverse team (smart sometimes being a codeword for cishet-white-male).  A much better rebuttal can be found in [don't surround yourself with smarter people](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2014/11/05/dont-surround-yourself-with-smarter-people/), which is a long but rewarding read that switches out _smart_ for _differently free_.

I don't think the dust has settled on the future of work (at least I _hope_ it hasn't, and that we're still in a phase of the pandemic that doesn't fully represent the new normal), but I do think there is a lot we can learn about the good & bad of remote from the natural experiment COVID-19 provided.  The negative impact on bridging/weak/cross-team ties is what I was most interested in exploring in [The effects of remote work on collaboration among information workers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01196-4.pdf).  I definitely felt that being fully remote 'impacted serendipity', but that is much more rigorously formulated and explored in the paper.  No solutions on offer here though - I wonder if more radical organizational changes are needed to succeed with a remote org (rather than take an existing organization structure and remove everyone from the office)?

Regardless of remote or in-person, articles on [how to have an honest one on one](https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2017/12/01/how-to-have-an-honest-one-on-one-meeting-with-an-employee/), fantastic [threads on soliciting feedback as a manager](https://twitter.com/kaydacode/status/1458084282530992140) great or the kitchen-sink of resources ([How to Lead People and Be a Manager](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R1O0OEsQpZcBcLheRlomDrmR2tyEpdRNFnjbLALmbH4/view)) - there's a tonne of great material to work through.  I've also ordered the book [Become an effective software engineering manager](https://pragprog.com/titles/jsengman/become-an-effective-software-engineering-manager/), though I do wonder when I'll get round to reading it (meanwhile James has released a new book on effective remote work, and I've still not finished going through his back-catalogue of [excellent posts on engineering management](https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/)).
