## Development

Capturing my frustrations on what an `npm-outdated` looks like for my Gatsby-powered blog, Ru Singh's [waving goodbye to static websites and more](https://rusingh.com/waving-thankful-goodbye-to-static-websites-and-more/) does make the 'DIY' option look like a poor choice.  Every time I think about switching to Wordpress (or something else) I run through the framework I used last time I switched by blog ([back in 2019](https://tjaddison.com/blog/2019/09/migrating-from-jekyll-to-gatsby/)) and always land on static sites.  For now.

One important feature for me is cost - ideally free, and [stack on a budget](https://github.com/255kb/stack-on-a-budget) is a good place to look for inspiration.  Another feature is performance, and [Speedlify](https://www.zachleat.com/web/speedlify/) can let you track performance over time (though Lighthouse scores are not [without their challenges](https://www.zachleat.com/web/lighthouse-deception/)).

Another month goes by and the GitHub issues for [optimize images during next build](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/19065)...maybe inches towards being implemented? I'll probably have to ignore this and rely on the default `next/image` component, though I'm not a fan of being locked into Vercel (as a free host).  When the time comes to migrate, the [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) library is probably how I'll get the MD/MDX used (there's even a [starter template](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mdx-remote)).

Finally, if you find yourself wanting a reminder of what the relentless pursuit of pragmatism looks like, these [quotes from Rasmus Lerdorf](https://en.m.wikiquote.org/wiki/Rasmus_Lerdorf) (creator of PHP) are worth reviewing.  As a taster - _"I actually hate programming, but I love solving problems."_
