## Let's try Vite

https://vitejs.dev/

```bash
yarn create @vitejs/app vite-test -- --template react
cd vite-test
yarn install
yarn dev
```

`yarn install` is required (despite the instructions suggesting otherwise!)

The `jsx` extension is mandatory by default - disabling gives:

```
[plugin:vite:import-analysis] Failed to parse source for import analysis because the content contains invalid JS syntax. If you are using JSX, make sure to name the file with the .jsx or .tsx extension.
```

Which is pretty clear - though wonder if there is any way around that?
