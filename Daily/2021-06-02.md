The [[Personal Blog]] has recently started to get a few red CLS entries in PageSpeed insights: https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=tjaddison.com&tab=mobile&hl=en_GB.  This is a shame as I had previously written on [[Jan]]

And looking at a sampling of URLs the shifts appear to be mostly text, which after looking in Edge DevTools clearly come from the font loading in.

I'm using fontsource: https://fontsource.org/ which doesn't allow for the `font-display` option to be changed to `optional` (which I believe would fix this).

The good news is someone shared a quick fix on a GitHub issue (asking for a way to configure the `font-display` value): https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/121#issuecomment-762863715

```javascript
// postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require(`tailwindcss`),
    require(`autoprefixer`),
    {
      postcssPlugin: true,
      Declaration: {
        "font-display": (node) => {
          if (node.parent.name === `font-face` && node.parent.type === `atrule`)
            node.value = `optional`
        },
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

Didn't know you could write a postcss plugin inline.  Neat!

After making this change the CLS on my pages dropped from 0.15-0.3 (bad!) to 0.  Nice ðŸ˜Ž.
