## Cleaning up SSRS reports subscriptions

```powershell
$uri = "http://yourserver/reportserver/ReportService2010.asmx"

# windows credentials, to use logged on user pass -UseDefaultCredential to New-WebServiceProxy instead
$cred = Get-Credential

$webSRV = New-WebServiceProxy -Uri $uri -Namespace SSRS.ReportingService2010 -Credential $cred

# Get all subs, recursive
$subs = $webSrv.ListSubscriptions("/")

# Look at the subs, raw
$subs | Out-GridView

# Problems are some columns don't tell us much
# - DeliverySettings (SSRS.ReportingService2010.ExtensionSettings)
# - Active (SSRS.ReportingService2010.ActiveState)

# Add IsDisabled so we can ignore or report on disabled subs
$subs = $subs | Select-Object *, @{ label='IsDisabled';expression={$_.Active.DisabledByUser} }

# How do we find out who was getting sent something?
# This expands a group of subs, though if a sub has a TO, CC, and BCC it now shows up three times
# Might be better to loop through and add them than try and do it inline
$failed.DeliverySettings.ParameterValues | Where-Object -Property Name -in @("TO","CC","BCC")

# Never going to work failures... (regex)
# permissions granted to user .* are insufficient
# subscription contains parameter values that are not valid
# The value .* is not valid for setting
# The specified string is not in the form required for an e-mail address

$failed = $subs | Where-Object -Property Status -Match "subscription contains parameter values that are not valid"

# Remove the subs
foreach($sub in $failed){ $webSRV.DeleteSubscription($sub.SubscriptionID) }
```
