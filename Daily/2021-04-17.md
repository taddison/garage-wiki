## Moving away from Google Analytics

Today my [[Personal Blog]] uses Google Analytics.  I'd rather not have this dependency (the JavaScript for one, the cookies for another, and then finally the lock-in).

So one thing to consider is export - and as there is probably a variable amount of work based on what gets exported (there isn't going to be a raw dump available), that also means considering what I really care about tracking.  I think it's going to be page views by day, device, referrer, url...and then probably some concept of distinct in there (distinct users? sessions?).
