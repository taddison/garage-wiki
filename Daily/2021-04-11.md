## Decluttering

Getting rid of some saved tabs...

Lots of interesting ideas and links here if I wanted to build a more serious CLI (see [[April 10, 2021]]).  There is probably an alternative to the tsqlscheduler task creator here (as most of it could easily be done via the command line?).

Still with command line, though this time a fully-featured app - using Ink.  Seen this before and would love to have an excuse to play around with it and build something.

Definitely not limited to just CTO/VPE for R&D - I've read a lot of this posts and think they're useful reading for almost any level of engineering.  Think I disagree pretty strongly with some suggestions, but there was a lot of new things for me to discover there too.
