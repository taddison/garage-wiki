Getting rid of some saved tabs that I've read and maybe plan to follow up with one day.  Perhaps one day they'll aslo appear on a [[Link Roundup]]?

**Node CLI**
Lots of interesting ideas and links here if I wanted to build a more serious CLI (see [[April 10, 2021]]).  There is probably an alternative to the tsqlscheduler task creator here (as most of it could easily be done via the command line?).

And then special call-out for Ink, which I've seen before and would love to try (CLI using React).

**Reading for CTO/VPE R&D**
Definitely not limited to just CTO/VPE for R&D - I've read a lot of these posts in the past and think they're useful reading for almost any level of engineering.  It's an opinionated list and I'm not sure I agree with them all, but I did discover a bunch of new resources.  I do enjoy a good aggregation of content.

**Container and VSCode**
This is interesting, but mainly it's the product of research into how can a container access git credentials from the host.  If I package an application up for developers to use (mounting a local repo to work with in the tool), can a `git push` work as intended?  Looks like the answer is maybe?

**Web Share**
I'd like to build an app (which can be a PWA) to share URLs to with some minimum content.  Today it's emails to myself, or manually syncing in a list (like this document).  Great that there is a native API which exists (and a PWA can register as a target!).

**Learning a foreign language**
The subreddit guide is great.  So is the about page, the resources page, and the content of the wiki.  The real challenge?  Where to get started with something!  In terms of a pratical next step I was quite impressed with the depth of content available on the 5000 French works Anki deck (come a _long_ way since I last pulled a deck).
