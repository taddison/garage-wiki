## Decluttering

Getting rid of some saved tabs...maybe one day future [[Link Roundup]] material?

**Node CLI**
Lots of interesting ideas and links here if I wanted to build a more serious CLI (see [[April 10, 2021]]).  There is probably an alternative to the tsqlscheduler task creator here (as most of it could easily be done via the command line?).

And then special call-out for Ink, which I've seen before and would love to try (CLI using React).

**Reading for CTO/VPE R&D**
Definitely not limited to just CTO/VPE for R&D - I've read a lot of these posts in the past and think they're useful reading for almost any level of engineering.  It's an opinionated list and I'm not sure I agree with them all, but I did discover a bunch of new resources.  I do enjoy a good aggregation of content.

**Container and VSCode**
This is interesting, but mainly it's the product of research into how can a container access git credentials from the host.  If I package an application up for developers to use (mounting a local repo to work with in the tool), can a `git push` work as intended?  Looks like the answer is maybe?
