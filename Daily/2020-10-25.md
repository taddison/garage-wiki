How can I check on the bundle size for my GatsbyJS site?

[size-plugin] (and it's gatsby variant [gatsby-plugin-webpack-size]) looked promising, though it looks like the plugin hasn't been updated for a while, and I also saw some weird results when running locally (files reported as 0B despite cleary not being 0B).  A bit of searching and it looks like [webpack-bundle-analyzer] might be the way to go, especially as it is actively maintained, is widely consumed, and supports a few different options for output (reports, files, or dumping the raw webpack stats).

In terms of which gatsby variant to take, I've opted to copy-paste the plugin contents directly, which amounts to the following:

```javascript
// gatsby-node.js
const BundleAnalyzerPlugin = require('webpack-bundle-analyzer').BundleAnalyzerPlugin

exports.onCreateWebpackConfig = ({ stage, actions }) => {
  if(stage === 'build-javascript' && process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
		actions.setWebpackConfig({
			plugins: [new BundleAnalyzerPlugin({
        generateStatsFile: true,
      })]
    })
  }
}
```

Adding a plugin to call through to another plugin - too much indirection and way too easy to let something get out of date.  Two variants do exist that basically do the same thing:
- [gatsby-plugin-webpack-bundle-analyzer]
- [gatsby-plugin-webpack-bundle-analyser-v2]

By default the plugin (when called with `analyzerMode: "report"`) will drop a `report.json` file in the public folder (webpack's output path which means for any deployment I can see the current report, including on on Netlify pull request previews.  Although the treemap would be useful for inspecting the bundle it doesn't really help for diffs - finding something to diff reports is the next step.
