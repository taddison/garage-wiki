Code-splitting in CRA:
- https://create-react-app.dev/docs/code-splitting/
- https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#route-based-code-splitting

Out of the box not working as intended - still a single chunk when trying to carve out an `Admin` component with a lot of heavy external dependencies only loaded for that UI...

Splitting a second component works for _that_ component, the only differences I can see are size of that component and it's location (and the fact it's the second).

The `Admin` component was different in a few ways:
- Had a default export _and_ exported a named variable
- Was stored differently (single file vs. in a folder)

But neither of these were the problem üòÅ - they did tip me off to what the actual problem was though!  That named export was being references _elsewhere_ in the app (not via `React.lazy`).  This is a good example of why taking a shortcut to share data between components is painful.

Instead of this:

```javascript
// admin.js
export const keys = ["a","b"]

export default Admin
```

I should have done this from the start

```javascript
// Keys.js
export const keys = ["a","b"]

// admin.js
import keys from "./Keys"
```

Lesson learned!
