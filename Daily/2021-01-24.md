Code-splitting in CRA:
- https://create-react-app.dev/docs/code-splitting/
- https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#route-based-code-splitting

Out of the box not working as intended - still a single chunk when trying to carve out an `Admin` component with a lot of heavy external dependencies only loaded for that UI...

Splitting a second component works for _that_ component, the only differences I can see are size of that component and it's location (and the fact it's the second).
