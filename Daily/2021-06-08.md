## Bicep

- az CLI was out of date, start there -> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli
  - Wow this took forever to install, 10 minutes!
- Install bicep under az: `az bicep install`
- Then decompile an ARM template `az bicep decompile --file .\template.json`
- Then open in VS Code - and get a prompt to install the extension - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep
- Some errors (location where it didn't belong) - remove those
- Login to az `az login`
- Set a target subscription `az account set --subscription {sub name or id}`
- Try a what-if deployment: `az deployment group what-if --template-file ./template.bicep --resource-group {resource group name}`
- Notice that the location mismatch shows up again (it says it'll try to delete the location on the resources that shouldn't have it)
