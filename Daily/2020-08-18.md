Dockerizing an R script.  Success looks like:

- Can run an R script with minimal impact to the OS (R versions, ODBC drivers, etc.)
- Can run multiple R scripts on the same OS
- What runs on the development machine looks like the production machine

Not looking to solve for scheduling or anything orchestration related, instead aiming to get it running on Windows 10 (dev) + Windows Server 2019 (prod).

Background reading (google 'r scripts in docker')...
- https://www.r-bloggers.com/running-your-r-script-in-docker/
- https://hub.docker.com/_/r-base/
- https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker

- https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/wiki

In brief:
- Life would be easier if we were not developing on Win10 (WSL2 is an option, but is it worth mandating that for all development?)
- Nothing that recent - solution with VS Code Docker + R plugins?  Again, seems like a radical departure from RStudio
  - First real challenge to the success requirements - is local development that important vs. local testing?
- The base image everyone builds on is running R on debian - is there a Windows base image out there that is common?
- Those caveats aside, this is a very straightforward use case.  Provisional searching for adding ODBC drivers shows that is also fairly common.

## Make something run

Luckily there are some MRO base images available, so will start there.  These are all linux based, so will need to build (or find) a base windows image later.

> Aside - two interesting links to peek inside containers - a decomposition: https://microbadger.com/images/nuest/mro and then a vulnerability scanner: https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy

From https://github.com/nuest/mro-docker

```bash
docker run -it --rm nuest/mro:3.5.3
# ...some time later...
source("demo.R")

# And in another terminal
docker stats
```

And we can see it burning 100% CPU to work through that benchmark.

Now to verify we can run _another_ version (why not go wild and use a whole different version and distribution, let's kick the tires on version 4, latest named version at https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/r-ver/tags):

> Version 4 was released in April this year - https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-announce/2020/000653.html.  The benchmarks are here: https://mac.r-project.org/benchmarks/

```bash
docker run -it --rm rocker/r-ver:4.0.0

# ...some time later...
# Note demo.R doesn't ship with this distribution
totalTestTime <- system.time({source(url("http://r.research.att.com/benchmarks/R-benchmark-25.R"))})

cat("Total test time:", totalTestTime[[3]], "seconds")
```

Running this in both images shows it does work, and also gives one useless data point (is R4 slower or is MRO faster?)

```
MRO 3.5.3
user     system elapsed
80.124   2.582  60.600

R4.0.0
user     system elapsed
312.141  10.470  79.599
```

Given it's only one command to check may as well run that benchmark on R3.5.3 too.

```bash
docker run -it --rm rocker/r-ver:3.5.3
```

And running the test gives us:
```
user     system elapsed
148.774  50.337  56.272
```

Would need to run these a few more times to really understand the impact - sounds like a potentially interesting thing to compare especially between R, MRO, Linux and Windows.

## Next steps

Go look for a suitable R image based on Windows Server!  And if not create the dockerfile for it...
