Dockerizing an R script.  Success looks like:

- Can run an R script with minimal impact to the OS (R versions, ODBC drivers, etc.)
- Can run multiple R scripts on the same OS
- What runs on the development machine looks like the production machine

Not looking to solve for scheduling or anything orchestration related, instead aiming to get it running on Windows 10 (dev) + Windows Server 2019 (prod).

Background reading (google 'r scripts in docker')...

In brief:
- Life would be easier if we were not developing on Win10 (WSL2 is an option, but is it worth mandating that for all development?)
- Nothing that recent - solution with VS Code Docker + R plugins?  Again, seems like a radical departure from RStudio
  - First real challenge to the success requirements - is local development that important vs. local testing?
- The base image everyone builds on is running R on debian - is there a Windows base image out there that is common?
- Those caveats aside, this is a very straightforward use case.  Provisional searching for adding ODBC drivers shows that is also fairly common.
