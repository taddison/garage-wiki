- Some weird behaviour with fonts where they occasionally fail with an error stating `resulted in a network error response: an "opaque" response was used for a request whose type is not no-cors` - that appears to be related to Gatsby's service worker
- To correct this would like to try and include the CSS inline (so it renders with the page) rather than including it in the onload event (that causes the flash of unstyled text)
- Theory here is that the CSS is small enough to be served with the page, and we can then rely on the `swap` behavior to render directly in `Inter Var` if present (or on a fast connection), and failing that it'll perform a layout shift as the font downloads
