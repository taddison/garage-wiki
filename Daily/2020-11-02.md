- Some weird behaviour with fonts where they occasionally fail with an error stating `resulted in a network error response: an "opaque" response was used for a request whose type is not no-cors` - that appears to be related to Gatsby's service worker
- To correct this would like to try and include the CSS inline (so it renders with the page) rather than including it in the onload event (that causes the flash of unstyled text)
- Theory here is that the CSS is small enough to be served with the page, and we can then rely on the `swap` behavior to render directly in `Inter Var` if present (or on a fast connection), and failing that it'll perform a layout shift as the font downloads

Looking again at this after a while and decided to...

- Use `Inter` not `Inter Var` (variable fonts don't appear to be widely supported and I'm not doing all that much in the way of design work)
- Use Google fonts (which is now possible because they have the `Inter` speciment) - maximum chance for caching

After that I checked Lighthouse and we're back with that additional call out to Google (penalty of 700ms for the connection!)...so back again to self-hosting, though this time it seems that typeface has been superseded by [fontsource].

Not ideal as we now have this...

```javascript
import "fontsource-inter/100.css";
import "fontsource-inter/200.css";
import "fontsource-inter/300.css";
import "fontsource-inter/400.css";
import "fontsource-inter/500.css";
import "fontsource-inter/600.css";
import "fontsource-inter/700.css";
import "fontsource-inter/800.css";
import "fontsource-inter/900.css";
```

Though this is interesting in that if a page uses an extra variant (e.g. 400, 500, 600) then it's an additional 36k downloaded for that weight. Does the design need 4 font weights? And what if we only included 100, 400, and 900? According to the MDN docs we might be ok...

From https://developer.mozilla.org/uk/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight:

```
If the exact weight given is unavailable, then the following heuristic is used to determine the weight actually rendered:

If a weight greater than 500 is given, the closest available heavier weight is used (or, if there is none, the closest available lighter weight).
If a weight less than 400 is given, the closest available lighter weight is used (or, if there is none, the closest available heavier weight).
If a weight of exactly 400 is given, then 500 is used. If 500 is not available, then the heuristic for font weights less than 400 is used.
If a weight of exactly 500 is given, then 400 is used. If 400 is not available, then the heuristic for font weights less than 400 is used.
This means that for fonts that provide only normal and bold, 100-500 are normal, and 600-900 are bold.
```

Though if the design could be reduced to only 3 (practically I think that's normal, bold, extrabold) maybe that works out too?
