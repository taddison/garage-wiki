## The final setup for font speed?

Inspired by [a tweet] I looked again to see how much work it'd be to get variable font support for Inter on the [[Personal Blog]] (previously wasn't supported by fontsource).

The good news is fontsource now supports variable fonts, and upgrading was straightforward (see PR: https://github.com/taddison/personal-site/pull/47).

Overall this is a few 100kB less of fonts (and no need to be picky about font weights), and around 10kB less CSS too.

Only thing missing from this is supporting fallback instead of swap - not available in fontsource yet.
