With the advent of tab groups, it is now even easier to amass a huge collection of articles.  This is the start of a divestment that has been a couple of months in the making.

**Orbit**
Spaced repetition (think Anki) taken to the next level.  What if we could get much, much more from reading, by changing the format in which we author and then consume the text?  As part of a _tools for thought_, Orbit is an attempt to reimagine the humble written word.

**Webmention Analytics**
Add visibility to your site's webmention implementation.  In addition to being something you can fork and deploy pretty quickly, it also demonstrates how you can build on top of your webmention data.  Assumes you're using webmention.io.

**TypeScript Deep Dive**
If you prefer learning via reading (and the official Typescript Handbook wasn't your style), I found the TypeScript Deep Dive to be an accessible and much more practical introduction (covers project setup, getting up and running with a React app).  In addition to the basics it covers real-world usage tips, contains a style guide, and a deep dive into the TypeScript compiler internals.

**DOM Events**
A fantastic visual exposition of the browser's DOM event system.  I can't think of a better way to teach/understand the model - great UI and full of features.
