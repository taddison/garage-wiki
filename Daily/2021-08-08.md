With the advent of tab groups, it is now even easier to amass a huge collection of articles.  This is the start of a divestment that has been a couple of months in the making.

### Orbit
Spaced repetition (think Anki) taken to the next level.  What if we could get much, much more from reading, by changing the format in which we author and then consume the text?  See [Tools for Transformative Thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/) for the background, [Orbit](https://withorbit.com/) for an introduction, or jump right into the [Orbit documentation](https://docs.withorbit.com/) for implementation details.  This is no less than an attempt to reimagine the humble written word as a tool for learning, and I think it's worth keeping an eye on.

### Webmention Analytics
Add visibility to your site's webmention implementation with [Webmention Analytics](https://mxb.dev/blog/webmention-analytics/).  In addition to being something you can fork and deploy pretty quickly, it also demonstrates how you can build on top of your webmention data.  Assumes you're using webmention.io.

### TypeScript Deep Dive
If you prefer learning via reading (and the official [Typescript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) wasn't your style), I found the [TypeScript Deep Dive](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/
) to be an accessible and much more practical introduction (covers project setup, getting up and running with a React app).  In addition to the basics it covers real-world usage tips, contains a style guide, and a deep dive into the TypeScript compiler internals.

### DOM Events
[DOM Events](https://domevents.dev/) is a fantastic visual exposition of the browser's DOM event system that really needs to be seen to appreciated (click the _Dispatch_ button!).  I can't think of a better way to teach/understand the model - great UI which is both simple, informative, yet feature-packed.
