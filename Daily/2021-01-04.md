## Bundle sizes

Completed the work today to remove moment (either using the cool `Intl.DateTimeFormat` API, or some very basic JavaScript) - and sadly the overall impact on bundle size for the app is fairly small.  Although we knocked off 200kB the overall bundle is still almost 1MB - mainly thanks for some massive firebase/firestore bundles.

Good news is that there appear to be some performance-oriented alternatives out there:
- https://github.com/samuelgozi/firebase-firestore-lite
- https://github.com/samuelgozi/firebase-auth-lite

The benchmarks are impressive - https://github.com/samuelgozi/firebase-firestore-lite/wiki/Firebase-Alternative-SDK-Benchmarks - so definitely going to check this out.

The other modules to target include lodash, and then lazy-loading for some infrequently used modules related to CSV parsing/generation.

It might be worth looking at what it might take to replace react-intl with some native features - overall I was very impressed with Intl ðŸ˜„.
