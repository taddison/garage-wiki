Time to rev the [starters] to [Next.js 9.5].

## tailwind-js

```shell
yarn outdated

@tailwindcss/ui     0.3.0   0.3.1  0.5.0  devDependencies

# -L for latest, ignore whatever the yarn.lock file has
yarn upgrade -L

# And then see if it works!
yarn dev
```

Only one reported issue from an upcoming Tailwind upgrade: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upcoming-changes#remove-deprecated-gap-utilities

Can opt in to the early deprecation (after verifying no hits for the pattern `-gap` anywhere):

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
future: {
    removeDeprecatedGapUtilities: true,
}
```

## tailwind

The TypeScript version.

A `yarn outdated` comes in a littler scarier this time - we've also got a major version of TypeScript to contend with ([4.0 was released this week]).

And after a `yarn upgrade -L` everything is working.

So now on to some improvements...

## postcss

The configuration in the JS starter is far simplier than the TS one - and this is mainly because Tailwind got inbuilt purge support recently, and I've been copy-pasting fowards my purgecss config for a while.

Starting from these baselines:

```javascript
// postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    'tailwindcss',
    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
      ? [
          '@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss',
          {
            content: [
              './pages/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
              './components/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
            ],
            defaultExtractor: (content) =>
              content.match(/[\w-/.:]+(?<!:)/g) || [],
          },
        ]
      : undefined,
    'postcss-preset-env',
  ],
};

// tailwind.config.js
...
purge: false,
...
```

Let's see how small we can get it.

Step 1 make sure there is still some styling after doing a production build:

```shell
yarn build
yarn start
# open http://localhost:3000
```

Now strip out the custom purge config, and place it into the tailwind config:

```javascript
// postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['tailwindcss', 'postcss-preset-env'],
};

// tailwind.config.js
...
purge: ['./**/*.tsx'],
...
```

Anything JSX producing TypeScript is good now - and a build/start cycle confirms we still have styling.  I believe (can't find the documentation though) that this purge parameter will ignore node_modules (either by default, or by looking at the `.gitignore`?).

We can also remove the explicit dependency on purgecss:

```shell
yarn remove @fullhuman/postcss-purgecss
```

Leaving us with a pretty lean configuration.

## What else?

Looking at the purged CSS I can see the `prose` class hanging out - which is being pulled in via tailwindui (which in turn is pulling in the [@tailwindcss/typography] plugin).  This looks *really neat*, and I think I could probably replace most of the custom CSS I wrote to style blog posts with that plugin.
