## Upgrading Gatsby from v2 v3

Upgrading all the packages seems to have just worked, with the caveat there is an error thrown by `gatsby develop`:

```
Unexpected key "pageData" found in preloadedState argument passed to createStore. Expected to find one of the known reducer keys instead: "nodes", "logs", "pages", "redirects",  
"schema", "definitions", "staticQueryComponents", "status", "webpack", "webpackCompilationHash", "config", "lastAction", "jobsV2", "pageDataStats", "components", "babelrc",      
"jobs", "nodesByType", "program", "resolvedNodesCache", "nodesTouched", "flattenedPlugins", "pendingPageDataWrites", "schemaCustomization", "inferenceMetadata",
"staticQueriesByTemplate", "queries", "visitedPages", "html". Unexpected keys will be ignored.
```

That and gatsby-image is now deprecated - https://gatsby.dev/migrate-images.

The error is easy enough to fix - run `gatsby develop` again and the error goes away, the plugin cleanup probably helped there.
