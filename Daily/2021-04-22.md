## Upgrading Gatsby from v2 v3

Upgrading all the packages seems to have just worked, with the caveat there is an error thrown by `gatsby develop`:

```
Unexpected key "pageData" found in preloadedState argument passed to createStore. Expected to find one of the known reducer keys instead: "nodes", "logs", "pages", "redirects",  
"schema", "definitions", "staticQueryComponents", "status", "webpack", "webpackCompilationHash", "config", "lastAction", "jobsV2", "pageDataStats", "components", "babelrc",      
"jobs", "nodesByType", "program", "resolvedNodesCache", "nodesTouched", "flattenedPlugins", "pendingPageDataWrites", "schemaCustomization", "inferenceMetadata",
"staticQueriesByTemplate", "queries", "visitedPages", "html". Unexpected keys will be ignored.
```

That and gatsby-image is now deprecated - https://gatsby.dev/migrate-images.

The error is easy enough to fix - run `gatsby develop` again and the error goes away, the plugin cleanup probably helped there.

So the image upgrade...

Fairly painless - the codemod only had a few hits, plus one manual update (in my SEO component) that it wasn't able to handle.  The guidance to use the `getSrc` function doesn't seem to apply either...so will have to see.

Was nice and easy after all:

```diff
- const shareImagePath = shareimage && shareimage.childImageSharp.fixed.src
+ const shareImagePath = shareimage && getSrc(shareimage)
```

Update: Spoke too soon!

The static images on the about page end up having the class `gatsby-image-wrapper-constrained` added - which sets `display: inline block`, and that is the rule that wins over `lg:hidden` in production, but not in dev.  Some ordering/specificity issue?

There is an issue - https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/30663 and the solution isn't great for me.  Maybe we don't need constrained?

So fixed doesn't help (the images become huge) - looks like this is going to need some more time, another time.
