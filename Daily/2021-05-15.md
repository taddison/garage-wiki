## Add Jest to Gatsby

The docs make it sound like a _lot of work_...https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/testing/unit-testing/.  But what if you want to test some utility functions, and you don't really care about testing in the Gatsby ecosystem?

Well that's a little easier...

```shell
yarn add jest babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env -D
```

And then create a `babel.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  presets: [['@babel/preset-env', {targets: {node: 'current'}}]],
};
```

And you can now write and execute tests using ES6.  Not quite as much effort as the guide makes out!
