Today is the day, finally clearing out the backlog of tabs - only taken ~4 months (See [[April 11, 2021]]).

### Access control, explained

[RBAC like it was meant to be](https://tailscale.com/blog/rbac-like-it-was-meant-to-be/) is the best introduction to access control I've ever read.  [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) is an extremely impressive product, and the documentation/blog posts are just as impressive.

### Engineering career growth

Looking at something like Dropbox's [career framework](https://dropbox.github.io/dbx-career-framework/) you could be fooled into thinking that if you could just *define* the ladder (Dropbox carefully don't call it a ladder, but it is) then you're part-way there.  This framing (level 1...N) is common, and I'm now wondering if it may be harmful when it comes to terminal levels (the combination of individual/company/team means growth is not possible _or_ required).

The specific problem I have with the ladder metaphor is that nobody climbs halfway up a ladder and stops, everyone wants to get to the top/get off the ladder.  This can lead to conversations with a senior engineer (who will never make staff) and the discussion focuses on 'why not staff'.  How can we instead focus on framing 'continued excellence as a senior engineer'.

Acknowledging the changing requirements of a role is important (if you level as senior now and then invest nothing in personal development would you still level as a senior in 5 years? 10 years?), and perhaps that is a way to frame a conversation about sustaining excellence.  This isn't purely technical either - reading through [career development for engineering managers](https://leaddev.com/professional-development/career-development-engineering-managers) how many of those points were you considering 5/10+ years ago?  [Gergely's tweet](
https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1427960129320804358) hits a similar note - and I'd say what makes those EM's unique is the ability to stay executing in the top N% for that role.

One thing I've found valuable in defining the senior+ roles is it allows you to identify projects/behaviours you would like to see other roles (either adjacent like EMs, or more junior in the same role) execute.  The list of those is long, but to get started here are a few I've enjoyed:
- [An incomplete list of skills senior engineers need beyond coding](https://www.elidedbranches.com/2021/06/an-incomplete-list-of-skills-senior.html)
- [Driving cultural change through software choices](https://www.elidedbranches.com/2020/11/driving-cultural-change-through.html)
- [Driving a technical strategy at scale](https://leaddev.com/scaling-teams-hypergrowth/driving-technical-strategy-scale-part-1)
- [Debugging engineering velocity and leading high performance teams](https://leaddev.com/productivity-eng-velocity/debugging-engineering-velocity-and-leading-high-performing-teams)

Even if you don't want to make these activities your main focus (EM/staff engineer), making participation in them part of your role/though process may be part of how you sustain excellence.

### Environment setup

One rough edge I've found with codespaces so far is environment setup - and the docs for [customizing your codespace](
https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/) sent me down a rabbit hole of environment configuration.

[Ren√©-Marc's dotfiles](https://github.com/renemarc/dotfiles) were my jumping-off point, and in addition to discovering [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) I also found the rather formidable [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).  A _lot_ to digest here (even the [how-to](https://www.chezmoi.io/docs/how-to/#personalizing-codespaces-for-your-account) is huge!), but it does look like the comprehensive solution that will let me work between Windows and macOS and linux.

But there's a lot of work to do to get there...
