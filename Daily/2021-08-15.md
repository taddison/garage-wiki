Taking a lot longer to clear the backlog of links than I thought.

### Local-first Software
Data longevity is something I've been thinking about a lot recently, especially when applied at a personal level (_can I leverage this data when I am 20, 30 years older?_).  The [Local-first software](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html) article covers this as well as 6 other concerns that point towards a very different kind of software.

In addition to the principles, the [Automerge](https://github.com/automerge/automerge) a library demonstrates that collaborative applications don't have to be incredibly challenging (leave that to the library authors).

I also noted [Replicache](https://doc.replicache.dev/how-it-works) that provides a hosted solution in the same space.

### Data Longevity - Datasets
While thinking about data longevity I realized that I care far more about programmatic consumption of data, more than merely reading it - and so my focus is on datasets.  The [US Library of Congress recommendation for datasets](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rfs/data.html) recommends:

1. Formats using well known schemas with public validation tool available
1. Line-oriented, e.g. TSV, CSV, fixed-width
1. Platform-independent open formats, e.g. .db, .db3

I've been focusing on [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) as my personal choice recently - the fact it's human readable is a huge plus, and it's also very close to the interchange format for most sites I'm building (JSON round trips well over the web!).

However, after reading (and frankly having my mind blown) [hosting SQLite databases on GitHub pages](https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2021/hosting-sqlite-databases-on-github-pages/) I might reconsider using it instead of 'JSON databases'.

### Growing Inclusive Behaviours
One way to start is defining those behaviours, and Chelsea Troy's [Rubric for Evaluating Team Member's Contributions to an Inclusive Culture](https://chelseatroy.com/2018/05/24/why-your-efforts-to-make-your-company-inclusive-arent-working/) is still my go-to post/resource in this space.  Highly recommended for everyone (not just managers).

### Up Next for organisations?
While everybody is thinking about more immediate changes related to remote work and the 'new-normal', what longer-term (think 2031) changes are already happening?  [How organisations are changing](https://swardley.medium.com/how-organisations-are-changing-cf80f3e2300) covers a lot of ground (and remote vs. in-office is fairly pivotal question that is covered).

### React from scratch
This in-depth and enlightening three-part series (starting with [Climbing Mount Effect](https://acko.net/blog/climbing-mt-effect/)) lays out some of the problems React's architecture solves, and then extends that architecture with some very different solutions.

If you've never read the details on why some of React's limitations exist (one-way data flow, rules regarding hooks, effects) - this piece is well worth the (fairly high) effort to work through.  And if you do understand those limitations, this piece shows another way of thinking about them - really helped consolidate my mental model of React.

If you're curious about building React from scratch I'd recommend the fantastic [Build your own React](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/).  Not only is the content great, but the presentation is fantastic.
