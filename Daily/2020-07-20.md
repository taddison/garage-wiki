Browsing a storage account today I about fell out of my seat when I saw a new setting 'Blob public access' set to _enabled_. The tooltip didn't make me feel any better either (it reads like enabled means your blobs are public :scream:).

After reading the documentation it was clear this setting is an override for _disabling_ access. If you set it to disabled, no container or blob can be accessed anonymously (this is what public means). If it's set to enabled you can then go and set one or more containers to be public.

> Except the \$web container which is always available anonymously, and is for hosting static websites from storage accounts.

It looks like this property showed up in the Azure portal UI fairly recently (I certainly haven't had this heart-attack before), and the Az PowerShell module was only updated to include it 10 days ago.

This property has no default setting, and if not set defaults to _enabled_. If you'd like to go through all your accounts and set it to false, you can use the script below. This assumes you don't have any containers that should have public/anonymous access.

```powershell
# 4.4.0 needed for the AllowBlobPublicAccess property
Import-Module Az -MinimumVersion 4.4.0
Connect-AzAccount

# Set to false to make the changes
$whatIf = $true

foreach($sub in Get-AzSubscription) {
  $sub | Select-AzSubscription | Out-Null

  foreach($acct in Get-AzStorageAccount) {
    if(-not $acct.EnableHttpsTrafficOnly -or ($acct.AllowBlobPublicAccess ?? $true)) {
      Set-AzStorageAccount `
        -ResourceGroupName $acct.ResourceGroupName `
        -Name $acct.StorageAccountName `
        -AllowBlobPublicAccess $false `
        -EnableHttpsTrafficOnly $true `
        -WhatIf:$whatIf
    }
  }
}
```
